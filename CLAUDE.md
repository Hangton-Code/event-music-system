# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A projector QR jukebox for events: the host page (`/`) is projected and plays YouTube videos; guests scan the on-screen QR to open `/guest` on their phones, search/browse YouTube, and queue songs. Vanilla JS everywhere — no framework, no bundler, no TypeScript, no tests.

## Commands

Use **bun** (not npm):

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # defaults are fine; moderation is off
bun start              # runs server.js on port 45416
bun run check-llm      # verify LLM_API_KEY and list available models
```

There is no lint, build, or test step. Verify changes by running the server and exercising both pages (`/` and `/guest`).

## Architecture

**The server owns all state.** `src/state.js` (`JukeboxState`) is the authoritative in-memory queue; every mutation fires `onChange`, and `server.js` broadcasts the full state snapshot to all WebSocket clients. The host page is a dumb player: it renders whatever `nowPlaying` says and reports back `ended`/`error` events, which make the server advance the queue. Host controls (skip/remove/move/filter toggle) also arrive over the same WebSocket. There is no persistence — a restart clears the queue.

**Song request pipeline** (`POST /api/request` in `server.js`):
1. `checkPlayable()` — YouTube oEmbed check rejects deleted/private videos (fails open on network errors; the host player auto-skips iframe error codes 101/150 as backstop for embed-disabled/region-locked videos).
2. `moderate()` — optional LLM filter, only when toggled on from the host page.
3. `state.add()` — enqueue and broadcast.

**YouTube without an API key** (`src/youtube.js`): search queries YouTube Music's internal InnerTube API (the JSON endpoint the music.youtube.com web app uses), filtered to the "Songs" category — music-only results (mostly audio tracks with album art, not music videos) with real artist metadata, whose videoIds play in the regular YouTube iframe. Video details for moderation come from the watch page's `ytInitialPlayerResponse`. The `SOCS/CONSENT` cookie avoids the EU consent wall. If search breaks, suspect InnerTube API/schema changes. `/api/browse` (guest page genre tabs/singer chips) is the same search but cached 30 min per query and filtered to singles (≤10 min) as a backstop against long live/compilation tracks.

**Moderation fail-open vs fail-closed** (`src/moderation.js`) — this distinction is deliberate, preserve it:
- **Fail-open** (approve) for infrastructure failures only: missing API key, HTTP error, timeout. A moderation outage must never stop the music.
- **Fail-closed** (reject) when the model answers but dodges: provider `content_filter` finish reason, or a reply without valid `{"approved": boolean}` JSON. This catches e.g. banned protest songs that Chinese-hosted models refuse to discuss.

The LLM is any OpenAI-compatible chat API, configured entirely via `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL`/`LLM_API_KEY` — no provider-specific code, with one opt-in exception: `LLM_WEB_SEARCH=true` attaches OpenRouter's web plugin (`plugins: [{id: "web"}]`) so the model sees live search results (usually the song's lyrics) instead of judging by title alone. Other providers reject the extra field, so it must stay opt-in. Don't rely on `response_format: json_object` (support varies) and don't set `temperature` unless `LLM_TEMPERATURE` is explicit (some models reject arbitrary values). The prompt includes `EVENT_CONTEXT` so the model judges fit for the occasion, not just explicitness.

**No dotenv dependency** — `server.js` has its own minimal `.env` loader. Dependencies are just express, ws, qrcode; keep it that way unless there's a strong reason.

## Deployment

Runs on a home server via `docker compose up -d --build` — the image is built locally from source; there is no registry, no CI build. A self-hosted GitHub Actions runner (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) rebuilds on every push to `main`. The container joins the external `reverseproxy` Docker network; `PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` is what the QR code points to, and the reverse proxy must forward WebSocket upgrades. Do not add `pull_request` triggers to the deploy workflow — the repo is public and the runner is self-hosted.

Static assets are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` on purpose (iOS Safari otherwise holds stale JS/CSS across deploys).
